# Guide: Project Management

Keep your rhythmic creations organized.

## File Organization
Keep your `.rne` files in a dedicated folder. RhythmNator tracks relative paths to your audio files, so it's best to keep the music in the same directory.

## Duplicating Projects
Use the "Duplicate" feature on the Home screen to create different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) from the same base project.

## Cloud Sync
While RhythmNator Editor is a desktop app, you can easily sync your projects using services like GitHub or Dropbox.
