# Guide: Note

Note events are the logic behind your rhythm game.

## What are Event Keys?
Every note can have an associated "Key". These keys are exported in the JSON so your game engine knows what to do when a note is hit.

## Common Keys
- **note_high**: Play a high-pitched sound.
- **note_low**: Play a low-pitched sound.
- **fx_visual**: Trigged a camera shake or flash.

## Customization
You can define any string as a key. This makes RhythmNator Editor compatible with any game engine.
