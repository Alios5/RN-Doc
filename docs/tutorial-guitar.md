# Tutorial: Make a game like Guitar

Learn how to use RhythmNator Editor to create charts for a guitar-based rhythm game.

## Step 1: Track Lanes
Create 5 tracks, each representing a "string" or button on the guitar controller.

## Step 2: Note Placement
Place notes that correspond to the guitar melody. Use "Sustains" for held notes and vibrato sections.

## Step 3: Event Mapping
Assign colors to each lane using event keys so your game engine knows which button to display on screen.

## Step 4: Testing
Play back the audio at 50% speed to ensure every note aligns perfectly with the guitar riffs.
