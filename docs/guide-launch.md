# Guide: Launch Project

How to successfully start and save your RhythmNator projects.

## Opening a Project
Simply click on a project card from the Home dashboard.

## File Format
Projects are saved as `.rne` files. These are lightweight JSON-based files that store your note positions and metadata.

## Auto-Save & Manual Save
Always use `Ctrl+S` to ensure your progress is saved. The editor will warn you if you have unsaved changes before closing.
