# Guide: Actions

Define specific game-specific logic with Actions.

## Custom Note Actions
Beyond just placement, each note can trigger a specific action.
- **note_hit**: Standard hit logic.
- **special_power**: Trigger a multiplier or visual effect.
- **camera_shake**: Move the game camera in sync with the beat.

## Editing Actions
Select a note and use the "Actions" panel to assign or create new triggers.
