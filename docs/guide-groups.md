# Guide: Groups

Organize your timeline with Smart Groups.

## Using Groups
Groups allow you to bundle multiple tracks together. This is useful for separating different sections of a song or different types of instruments (e.g., all percussion tracks in one group).

## Logic and Hierarchy
- **Visibility**: Toggle group visibility to clear up your workspace.
- **Batch Actions**: Apply changes to all tracks within a group simultaneously.
- **Export**: Groups are preserved in the JSON export for organized game logic.
