# Guide: BPM

Success in rhythm games depends on perfect BPM.

## Auto-Detection
RhythmNator Editor can automatically analyze your track to find the average BPM.

## Manual Adjustment
If the detection isn't perfect, you can manually input the BPM value in the side panel.

## Offset
Adjust the offset (in milliseconds) to align the "1" beat perfectly with the audio waveform.
